# elevator_simulation
Elevator Simulation written in Java and using JavaFX for the UI.

This is a sample problem provided to me, some might find it useful.

Requirements and Features:

* Building has 5 floors and 1 elevator
* Show controls on each floor
* Elevator moves slow enough to test someone pushing button on different floor and for user to see what's happening
* Show current position of elevator
* GUI interface
* Should work and act like a real elevator. For example, the elevator can't go down from bottom, can't go up on the top floor.
* An elevator that is going up won't stop for down request and vice versa
